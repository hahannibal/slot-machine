# slot-machine
Hi! This is a small, console slot-machine. Can be played on 1 or all rows
 - The starting money can be set up
 - A gamegrid can be chosen (smallest grid is 3x3)
 - With a bigger grid, there is a bigger multiplier on winning rows
 - GameMode can be changed at any time between playing in 1 row or all rows
 
# How to play:
While starting the game, you will be presented with some questions:
 - Your starting money, here you will have to enter an integer
 - How big the grid should be? The minimum is 3x3 and the length and width will be the same
 - GameMode: do you want to play on 1 row or all rows? Playing on all rows costs more  
   
After this initial setup, you will see your initial game coins, the grid and if you won on the selected row(s).
The gamemode can be changed after every round by hitting the BackSpace. If you just want to play another round, you can hit the Space.
